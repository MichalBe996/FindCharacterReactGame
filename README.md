# FindCharacterReactGame

This is React game based on Finding Wally game. 
Basically if your click is not in range of coordinates of the character box, the box border will be red and the message on the top
will say that your character is yet to be found. 
If character is clicked, box will change color to green and the message will tell you that you are correct.
This is demo version, I am about to implement list of characters that would be randomly chosen so that the app has replayability potential. I'm thinking also about
 implementing timer that shows you how quickly you can find said character.
